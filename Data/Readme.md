# Data and metadata 

* The raw and normalised transcript counts for the project can be found here. 
This repository also contains additional files to reproduce the findings of the paper.

* The metadata.xlsx file allows the mapping of the cell names (library names on ArrayExpress) to more understandable names for cell type identification. The file also contains a description of the activation condition, cell type, age and species for each cell.

* Cells from experiments SS57, SS58 and SS59 are old B6 replicates captured on a different machine to validate that the shift in variability is not caused by technical effects.
